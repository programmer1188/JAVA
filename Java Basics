// 1.Variables

// Java : Case Sentitive(There is difference between upper and lower case letters) 
// variables: has a name and value. values can be numbers or text with specifying datatype.
// declaration and initialization 


//data Type
//1. Integer int MaxInt = 2147483647;
//2. Long long muchMore = 2147483647 *10000000;
//3. Float float fraction = 56.89; stores 6-7 decimal points;
//4. Double double fraction = 99.275; stores 15 decimal points
//5. String = "Text";
//6. Character char answer = 'y'; //char can only store one letters
//7. Boolean boolean fact = true;

//Arithmetic Operations
//1. Addition         int x = 2+3;
//2. Subtraction      int y = 4-5;
//3. Multiplication   int days = 7*5;
//4. Division         double div = 5/2 = 2   5/2.0 = 2.5;
//To get acuurate results to decimal points make sure one of the numbers is double.

//Truncation double div = 5/2 = 2 here the actual answer is 2.5 but the value is truncated to 2

//Cutting off the digits to the right of a decimal points


//Casting: convert double to Integer or int to double
