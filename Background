How code is executed

Source code(Hello.java) -> Java compiler -> ByteCode(Hello.class) -> JVM(Interpreter) to run Bytecode -> OS

JVM is platform dependent.

Compiler -> JDK -> Latest Version 17 But use Java 8 features -> Compiler converts all instructions into machine language in one go.
Interpreter -> JVM
Editor -> Sublime, Visual Studio Code
IDE(Integrated Development Environment) -> Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA

Debugging: Remove bugs

Jshell -> Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL) 

Compile -> javac file name (javac Hello.java) JDK
Run -> java class name (java Hello) JVM
